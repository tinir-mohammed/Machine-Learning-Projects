<h1>1. Predicting IMDb Rating of Films Using Gradient Boost Regression</h1>
In this project, a regression model is used to predict the IMDb score of a film from information
such as its director, cast, and genre. The dataset used to train and test the model has been
obtained from Kaggle, a popular source of datasets, and it contains 5,043 unique data points.
Predicting IMDb scores is a regression problem which we are solving using the gradient boosting
algorithm. With an R2 value of 0,46, the model can be said to perform fairly better than a constant
prediction.
