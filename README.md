A compilation of my Machine Learning project exploring various algorithms

<h1>1. Predicting IMDb Rating of Films Using Gradient Boost Regression</h1>
In this project, a regression model is used to predict the IMDb score of a film from information
such as its director, cast, and genre. The dataset used to train and test the model has been
obtained from Kaggle, a popular source of datasets, and it contains 5,043 unique data points.
Predicting IMDb scores is a regression problem which we are solving using the gradient boosting
algorithm. With an R2 value of 0,46, the model can be said to perform fairly better than a constant
prediction.

<h1>2. Predicting Lung Diseases from Respiratory Acoustics</h1>
<h2>Development of Classification Methods for Wheeze and Crackle Using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC): A Deep Learning Approach</h2>
The most common method used by physicians and pulmonologists to evaluate the state of the lung is by listening to the acoustics of the patient's breathing by a stethoscope. Misdiagnosis and eventually, mistreatment are rampant if auscultation is not done properly. There have been efforts to address this problem using a myriad of machine learning algorithms, but little has been done using deep learning. A CNN model with MFCC is expected to mitigate these problems. The problem has been in the paucity of large enough datasets. Results show 0.76 and 0.60 for recall for wheeze and crackle respectively, these number are set to increase with optimization.
